This is a refurbished version of hcwiid. At the present time, this version is
not on hackage (I'm waiting on the original author to transfer maintenance over
to me).

So, the only way to get the new version is by cloning this repo. I'll remove
this notice when (if) a new version is uploaded to hackage.

First things first: How the frag do I compile the tests in test/?

You need to do two things:
1) Compile the program with -rtsopts (enable RTS command line flags)
2) Run the program with +RTS -V0
   This will disable the internal ticks used for profiling, which
   in turn will make the runtime system not use the SIGALRM signal,
   which libluetooth uses for its own internal purposes and is necessary
   to connect to the wiimote.

   (This bit is the work of Paolo Capriotti, whose mastery of GHC
    baffles me every time.)
